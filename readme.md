## Overview
This is a React Application build to shows Now Playing Movies details. This details are fetched from TMDB API which returns the desired information regarding different Movies. We have filtering enabled based on Genres listed and Movies will be displayed according to the selected Genures. There is a Movie Rating Filter to enable the user to filter Movies based on Movie Rating.
